This project establishes the back-end server for the gradual revamping of the Capstone project.

The backend continues to be a work in progress as this material is taking longer to really sink in, and online sources for assistance aren't like they were with the front end. It'll come with time and repetition.

The dropdown does not sort by teams at this point, it can only display all teams when any option is selected. The Logout link currently simulates the behavior of a logout link but the session implementation has not been figured out.
